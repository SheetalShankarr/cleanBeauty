# 🌿 A simple clean beauty web app — Transparency Made Simple  

Many cosmetics and skincare products are marketed as “clean,” but it’s not always clear what’s really inside. **CleanBeauty** is a simple web app designed to help users understand the ingredients in their products by identifying potentially harmful or controversial substances.  

Paste a list of ingredients (separated by commas) and instantly see if any are flagged — empowering you to make more informed and confident choices.
